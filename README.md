# What is LTC cash?

LTCA cash is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. LTCA cash uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. LTCA Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the BiYanZu Core software, see https://ltccash.org
